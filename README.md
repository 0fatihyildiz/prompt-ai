## AI Prompt Sharing Platform

This project is an AI prompt sharing platform that allows users to discover and utilize AI prompts across various categories. You can find prompts for content creation, SEO, social media marketing, and more, saving time and improving efficiency. 

With its open-source structure, developers can contribute to the project and add new features. This platform is an ideal resource for anyone looking to make the most of AI tools.

## Overview
- `/components` - Contains reusable React components.
- `/data` - Contains data related to prompts and categories.

## Inspiration
- `cursor.directory` - I used it for a fast and user-friendly interface structure.
- `semrush.com` - I used it for efficient prompt content.


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
